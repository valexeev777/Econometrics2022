    "\n",
    "Hypotheses are claims, and we can use statistics to prove or disprove them. At this point, hypothesis testing structures the problems so that we can use statistical evidence to test these claims. So we can check whether or not the claim is valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Defining Hypotheses\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, we should understand which scientific question we are looking for an answer to, and it should be formulated in the form of the **Null Hypothesis** ($H_0$) and the **Alternative Hypothesis** ($H_1$ or $H_a$). Please remember that $H_0$ and $H_1$ must be mutually exclusive, and $H_1$ shouldn't contain equality:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $H_0$: $\\mu=x$, $H_1$: $\\mu\\neq x$ (two-tailed test)\n",
    "- $H_0$: $\\mu\\leq x$, $H_1$: $\\mu> x$\n",
    "- $H_0$: $\\mu\\geq x$, $H_1$: $\\mu< x$\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Assumption Check\n",
    "\n",
    "To decide whether to use the **parametric** or **nonparametric** version of the test, we should check the specific requirements listed below:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Observations in each sample are independent and identically distributed (IID/i.i.d./iid).\n",
    "- Observations in each sample are normally distributed.\n",
    "- Observations in each sample have the same variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Selecting the Proper Test\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we select the appropriate test to be used. When choosing the proper test, it is essential to analyze how many groups are being compared and whether the data are paired or not. To determine whether the data is matched, it is necessary to consider whether the data was collected from the same individuals. Accordingly, you can decide on the appropriate test using the chart below.\n",

    "\n",
    "## 4. Decision and Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "After performing the hypothesis testing, we obtain a related **p-value** that shows the significance of the test.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the p-value is smaller than the **alpha** (the significance level), in other words, there is enough evidence to prove $H_0$ is not valid; you can reject $H_0$. Otherwise, you **fail to reject** $H_0$ (do not use the term \"accept\", instead use \"fail to reject\"). Please remember that rejecting $H_0$ validates $H_1$. However, failing to reject $H_0$ does not mean $H_0$ is valid, nor does it mean $H_1$ is wrong.\n",
